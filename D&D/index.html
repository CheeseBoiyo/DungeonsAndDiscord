    <h1>Dungeons and Discord Website!</h1>
    <p style="border: solid black 1px; width:700px">This is the offical website made by CheesBoi#3649, after not having internet i started to get back into coding my own small websites. It is incedibly hard because i cant google things and i only have the other files with all of my other works on my laptop but i am extremely lazy to search all that. The menu is currently a W.I.P. Currently getting back is pretty fun, got something to do thats not moping around. The code is very iffy and will most likely be made better after i get internet access, i will also inform all of you and put this on my github.</p>

    <h3>Updates:</h3>
    <ol style="width: 500px">
      <li style="border: solid black 2px; padding: 5px;">Since i dont have access to github i will temporarily place updates here to keep my sane. As of the time of writing the main html is made for the main places for NPC's and Characters, test3 is still around for company.</li>
      <li style="border: solid black 2px; padding: 5px;">Fixed up charactermain.html pretty well if i say so myself (and i say so). Added another CSS for Player Characters, Added Cursercat8.jpg as placeholder image for every character that has been added till now (CHeyon and Johnny Johnwell). test3 now returns you to the index instead of doing jack shit.</li>
      <li style="border: solid black 2px; padding: 5px;">Added a lil' die, also made the main thing long as fuck so more shit can fit on it. Added more characters and used other placeholders for each story, except for overlapping characters. Almost all Player Characters from Story 1-3 have been added (yes story 3 has a mysterious player character). Also made updates a little easier to look at.</li>
      <li style="border: solid black 2px; padding: 5px;">Added a frick ton of info, if you click on a character you see what has been seen in the games until now. There are still the old cursedcat placeholders but when i can get the pics of everyone im going to put them in like that.</li>
      <li style="border: solid black 2px; padding: 5px;">Added everyone, info about them people know. now time to add the NPC's. Yayyyyyyyyyy pls kill me</li>
      <li style="border: solid black 2px; padding: 5px;">realised a mistake thatll take a bit to fix. also slowly losing my mind</li>
      <li style="border: solid black 2px; padding: 5px;">Mistake fixed, im sleepy as fuck. wonder how many mistakes ill make.</li>
      <li style="border: solid black 2px; padding: 5px;">Didnt update these cuz i didnt feel like it. Basically added most NPC's that are at least a bit important. Added new placeholder pic, its the X SCP-079 portrays when he doesnt want to talk. As usual a bit of looks tweaking.</li>
      <li style="border: solid black 2px; padding: 5px;">Made it so you can see what you're hovering over to make it cooler and dont click the cat.</li>
