    <h2>Info:</h2>
    <p style="width: 700px;">Wizard in the first ever story. He was a good wizard who helped his friends alot, after Hodor sliced the Big Bad Evil Guy in half and they all killed his minions they returned to the Blissful Inn. However Johnaton had kept secrets from the party, namely 15 gp. This would be his undoing as Hodor fucking killed him.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 >Status: </h2> <h2 style="color:red;"> Deceased, Killed by Hodor</h2>

    <h2>Combat Prowess:</h2>
    <p style="width: 700px;">Low, god made him weak as hell on accident (sorry bout that). He could cast 2 cantrips and lost his spellbook so could not do much more, still did quite some damage though.  </p>
