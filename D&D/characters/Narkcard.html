    <h2>Info:</h2>
    <p style="width: 700px;">Stealthy as fuck rogue who can help by causing a nice little ruckus. He was with Cheyon, Johnny and Falco as they attacked the necromancer but hit his head and fell unconcious. After waking up he was back at the bar and the party had defeated the bad guys. After a while they went to find an informant, after causing a ruckus so that Cheyon could sneak easier he went inside and got knocked out by a weird chicken breast. After waking they returned to the Blissfull Inn</p>
